## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learnt from this project was placing a hover state on an image and really making the project be in equilibrium across all screens, both phones and desktops. 


### Continued development

development I'd like a more detailed method of placing a hover on an image without using "div" and a better way to place an object without making use of overflow to hide the x-scroll bar.
